# These conformace tests are no longer in sync with the latest specification
# and expect compareDocumentPosition() to return:
# DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC | DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED
# for disconnected nodes (missing PRECEDING / FOLLOWING information).
# We cannot check rebaseline them because their output is likely to change
# between test runs as it decides PRECEDING / FOLLOWING using pointer
# comparison.
